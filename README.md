# 🜂 **Cohærentia — The Harmonic Intelligence Project**
### *Independent Research Initiative founded by Sharaf Samiur Rahman*

---

## 🧭 Mission
Cohærentia explores the **science of coherence** — aligning human, technological, and planetary systems through measurable intelligence, resonance, and ethical stability.  
It advances the concept of **Harmonic Intelligence**, where coherence, resonance, and constraint integrity operate as the universal principles of sustainable order.
