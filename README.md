# üúÇ Coh√¶rentia ‚Äî The Harmonic Intelligence Project

### Independent Research Initiative founded by **Sharaf Samiur Rahman**

---

## üß≠ Mission
Coh√¶rentia explores the **science of coherence** ‚Äî aligning human, technological, and planetary systems through measurable intelligence, resonance, and ethical stability.  
It advances the concept of **Harmonic Intelligence**, where coherence, resonance, and constraint integrity operate as the universal principles of sustainable order.
